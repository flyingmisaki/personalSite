Intro:
HexRig is a unity project that aims at approximating real life movement and allows physics-based control of a virtual character using a “hexabody” collision model. Allows for a full range of motion in a roomscale environment.

Walking and running :x
The rig is capable of walking and running on different types of terrain smoothly. The spring spine dampens shocks and vibrations.

Roomscale movement:x
The rig can move around in its environement as the user moves around in real life. It will follow the users head position.

Physical crouching and tiptoeing:x
The rig's head height is mapped to the user's real head height. This ensures accurate vertical head movement.

Virtual crouching and tiptoeing:x
The rig's head height can be manually ajusted to virtually crouch and tiptoe.

Jumping:x
The rig is Capable of preloading and releasing a jump. It also takes into account players's hand inertia emulating a jump.

Climbing:x
The rig can move vertically with physically accurate climbing mechanics.

Interacting with objects:x
The rig can push or grab objects with one or both hands. Object properties such weight and size are reflected in the dynamics of these interactions.

Configurable:
The bodies properties such as user height, speed, weight and jump strength can be tweaked depending on the nature of its use.
